1. Perform tokenization (Whitespace, Punctuation-based, Treebank, Tweet, MWE) using NLTK library. 
Use porter stemmer and snowball stemmer for stemming. Use any technique for lemmatization. 
2. Perform bag-of-words approach (count occurrence, normalized count occurrence), TF-IDF on data. 
Create embeddings using Word2Vec. 
3. Perform text cleaning, perform lemmatization (any method), remove stop words (any method), 
label encoding. Create representations using TF-IDF. Save outputs. 
4. Create a transformer from scratch using the Pytorch librar 
5. Morphology is the study of the way words are built up from smaller meaning bearing units. Study 
and understand the concepts of morphology by the use of add delete table
